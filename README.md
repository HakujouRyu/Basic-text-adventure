A very basic text adventure game

# Welcome Adventurers!
This is just a simple text game to play around with my coding skills. It is not balanced or complete in any way.

If for some reason you want to run it, all you need to do is `python adv.py`.

To move around you may enter a cardinal direction, `move {cardinal direction}` or simply rhe first letter of the direction you'd like to move in.
